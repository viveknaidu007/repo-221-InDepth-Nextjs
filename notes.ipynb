    "Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered or statically exported React applications with ease. It provides a hybrid static and server rendering, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. With features like automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and seamless integration with APIs, Next.js simplifies the development of complex applications. It supports TypeScript, dynamic routing, and offers built-in CSS and Sass support. Ideal for SEO-friendly websites, Next.js empowers developers to create fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications efficiently."

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npx create-next-app@latest project_name\n",
    "   cd project_name\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "3. **Add dependencies** (optional): Install any additional libraries like `axios`, `tailwindcss`, etc.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   npm install axios\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
